# M5Cardputer_Rugged_Lanyard_Plate
A 3D printable rugged lanyard plate to add on to existing mounts of an M5Cardputer

Made with FreeCAD, both the stl and the FreeCAD project file are provided here. I've printed the lanyard plate in PETG at around 15% infill and it is totally rugged. However PLA is also fine. You need a 16mm thread length M2 bolt with the 4mm diameter allen head to fit in the recessed hole and still close the M5Cardputer case together. If you use the bolt and 1 or 2 technics connectors it is totally bomber, and even more so with all 4 technics connectors.
